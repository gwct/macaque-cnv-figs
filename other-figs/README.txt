figX1:  CNV length by number of exons overlapped for macaques and humans.
figX2:  Distributions of how many times a gene is affected by a SV.
figX3:  Generates many figures relating to frequency spectrums of SVs.
        figX3A:     CNV length distributions for CNVs present at each frequency (i.e. 1/32, 2/32, etc...)
        figX3B:     Same as X3A, but excluding frequency 1.
        figX3C:     The site frequency spectrum for macaque CNVs.
        figX3D:     Same as X3C, but excluding frequency 1.
        figX3E:     The frequency spectra for SNPs overlapped by CNVs for each CNV frequency.
        figX3F:     The overall SNP frequency spectra for SNPs overlapped by CNVs.
        figX3G:     The number of SNPs by the number of CNVs for each CNV frequency. Frequency 1 is shown in green.
        figX3H:     The number of CNVs per individual. Average shown as dotted line. Number of CNVs in all individuals shown in last category.
